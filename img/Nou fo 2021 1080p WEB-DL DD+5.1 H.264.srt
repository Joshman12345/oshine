1
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,083
Morning.

2
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,167
What did the doctor say yesterday?

3
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,625
My blood pressure is a bit high.

4
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,000
That's all.

5
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,500
High blood pressure?

6
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,625
That's bad.

7
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,667
2016 HONG KONG BALLET COMPETITION

8
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,083
You might not carry to term.

9
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,375
You had better stay home.

10
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,583
I can't.

11
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,875
Why not?

12
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,500
Go back to work after the baby is born.

13
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,625
Good boy.

14
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,458
Honey.

15
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,250
Be careful.

16
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,250
You, be careful.

17
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,167
- You, be careful.
- You, be careful.

18
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,125
- You.
- You.

19
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,208
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.

20
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,750
Why are you all standing around?

21
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,917
Back to work!

22
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,833
Boy, snap out of it.

23
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,333
Something big is going down tonight.

24
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,875
Look alive.

25
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:49,917
Here.

26
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:51,667
What's this?

27
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,833
What else? It's for you.

28
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:57,167
Miscellaneous baby stuff from my children.

29
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,375
My wife told me to give it to your wife.

30
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,583
Thank you.

31
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,167
But I'm having a son.

32
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,833
I don't need the girl stuff.

33
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,292
Then have a daughter next.

34
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,792
I'm not taking it back.

35
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,125
- My wife will kill me.
- Okay.

36
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,333
Thank you.

37
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:14,250
Don't thank me yet.

38
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,583
You received another complaint.

39
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:17,292
What now?

40
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,083
Did you arrest Tall Ming
in Causeway Bay last week?

41
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,292
Yes.

42
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,125
Did you notify the division commander?

43
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,458
If I waited for his order,
it would have been too late.

44
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,083
Same excuse again.

45
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,458
You solved the case.

46
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,667
But Officer Kwan lost face.

47
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,917
You're good, but you're not a team player.

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,750
For once, try to get along with others.

49
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,458
So what happened? Did you settle it?

50
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:40,958
I took him out to dinner and fixed it.

51
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:43,292
- Great.
- Pay me back for the dinner.

52
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,500
I owe you. Let's go.

53
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:49,833
I am the field commander
of this joint operation.

54
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,083
Here is tonight's operation order.

55
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,542
Wong Kwun. We have tracked him for years.

56
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,375
Murder, arson, blackmail,

57
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,292
drugs, you name it.

58
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,542
CIB has a lead that at 9 p.m. tonight

59
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,625
Long Hair from the Vietnamese Gang

60
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,833
will do a major drug deal with Wong Kwun.

61
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,833
We will take them down
no matter how strong they are!

62
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,000
Our final briefing
will be at 8 p.m. tonight.

63
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,750
This operation is confidential.

64
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,417
The location will be released
before the operation starts.

65
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,208
We will arrest all those scumbags tonight!

66
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,375
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,292
Dismissed.

68
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,333
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,250
- Yes, Beau?
- Bong.

70
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,042
I need your help.

71
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,500
Without you,
tonight's operation might get canceled.

72
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,042
- All right.
- Hurry.

73
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,542
I can't handle it. Okay?

74
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,833
I'm on my way.

75
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:43,875
Where the hell is he?

76
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,167
Beau!

77
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,208
You're late.

78
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:48,583
- The brass is waiting.
- Why will the operation be canceled?

79
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,375
You're lying again.

80
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,167
If I didn't say that, would you have come?

81
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,417
The brass is waiting for you.

82
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,333
It's urgent. Help me, okay?

83
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,542
Refuse this and I will be dead.

84
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,292
My future will be ruined, okay?

85
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,208
Considering I'm your boss,

86
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,250
classmate, and good buddy,

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,292
please help.

88
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,292
I'm not your buddy.

89
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,833
Sorry! The busy man has finally arrived.

90
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:13,292
Officer Cheung!

91
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,500
How are you, Officer Chow?

92
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,333
Not as fit as you.

93
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:19,292
Please sit. I will introduce everyone.

94
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,167
Officer Tai, our division commander.

95
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,750
You know Officer Lee.

96
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,042
This is Officer Ho.

97
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,875
- Senior Superintendent of CAPO.
- Hello, Officer Ho.

98
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,333
- Mr. Youli Chan.
- Hello.

99
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,958
And his son.

100
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,042
Mr. Chan has been our longtime supporter

101
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,875
and has asked to meet with you today.

102
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,958
Do you remember

103
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,750
the Hang Choi Bank robbery
in Tai Kok Tsui in 2013?

104
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,750
Officer Cheung cracked the case.

105
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,750
And, of course, in 2016,

106
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,208
the gunfight at Sai Kung Pier.

107
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,208
Officer Cheung singlehandedly captured

108
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,292
seven international criminals
with just two rounds.

109
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,083
- Gosh!
- They were former soldiers.

110
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,125
- Amazing.
- Amazing.

111
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,000
To Officer Cheung,
who has solved many cases over the years!

112
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,458
- Cheers, Officer Cheung.
- Cheers, Officer Cheung.

113
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,375
Gentlemen,

114
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:10,625
you asked me here today.

115
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,208
What can I do for you?

116
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,875
Officer Cheung, we know you are good,

117
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:19,875
but you just need

118
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,125
an opportunity.

119
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,292
Hello, Officer Cheung.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,625
I am Mr. Chan's lawyer.

121
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,042
A few nights ago,

122
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,500
Mr. Chan Jr. had too much to drink

123
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,208
and accidentally injured this policeman.

124
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,375
He has forgiven Mr. Chan Jr.

125
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,708
- Therefore--
- I get it.

126
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:43,167
But I have already
turned in the report, so--

127
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,125
It's back on your desk.

128
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,375
Give it back to me next week.

129
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,750
That's right.

130
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,792
As you can see,

131
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:55,625
the victim is enjoying his lunch.

132
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,250
So even if it gets to court,
it may not hold water.

133
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,458
Beau, don't fuck around.

134
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,750
Don't you know me by now?

135
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,583
I want to help you
get promoted, that's all.

136
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:04,792
You set me up!

137
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,417
How? I'm not asking you to sell your ass.

138
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,917
This is worse.

139
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:15,250
Whether you agree or not,
the result will be the same.

140
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,042
The brass wants to impress the rich guy.

141
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,708
Just play along.

142
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:24,042
You're not young anymore
and will soon be a dad.

143
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,250
Please, I beg you.

144
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,625
I love you.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,042
Sorry.

146
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,792
Officer Cheung, are you okay?

147
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,875
He's fine. He just drank too much water.

148
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,625
Have you made it clear?

149
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,542
Crystal clear.

150
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,083
This is good tea.

151
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,083
Waiter.

152
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,667
Is it expensive?

153
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,000
It's the best Iron Buddha Tea.

154
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,333
- It's 600,000 dollars per catty.
- 600,000 dollars?

155
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:16,958
It's good stuff.

156
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,000
I took two sips.

157
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,708
200 dollars should cover it.

158
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,042
Excuse me. I must go.

159
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,208
Officer Cheung.

160
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,375
Do you know what you're doing?

161
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,292
Of course I do. Do you?

162
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,375
Bong!

163
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm warning you now.

164
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,042
Listen up.

165
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,333
If anybody screws up,

166
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,208
they will have hell to pay.

167
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,292
Chow.

168
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,250
Why are you taking so long
over some Kevlar vests?

169
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,250
What's wrong?

170
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,208
I don't have your UI.

171
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,042
What?

172
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,292
Any questions?

173
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,458
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

174
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,417
Let's go!

175
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,542
Sorry, Bong.

176
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,750
I'm just following the procedure.

177
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,333
Your UI is not showing.

178
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,292
You're not a part of this operation.

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,167
Yes?

180
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,458
Location?

181
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,875
Location?

182
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,417
I can't tell you.

183
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,042
Are you fucking with me too?

184
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,292
Not me. I'm just following orders.

185
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,375
I told you to be a team player.

186
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,083
- Don't upset the higher-ups.
- They're boot-lickers!

187
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,375
CAPO and ICAC are investigating them.

188
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,125
But that takes time, right?

189
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,625
Yiu, you know I have waited four years!

190
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,792
I must capture
the bastard Wong Kwun tonight.

191
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,208
I know.

192
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,500
You just can't let it go. Neither can I.

193
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,667
Stay put.

194
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,125
They're looking to get rid of you.

195
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,208
I don't want you to lose your job.

196
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:25,375
Trust me. Wong Kwun is an easy job.

197
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,167
I will personally bring him back.

198
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,667
- You can take his statement, okay?
- Quit the bullshit! Location!

199
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,083
- Location!
- Goodbye.

200
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,667
Call your friend in CIB.

201
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,417
- I will get the car.
- Now!

202
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,750
OB calling Control Post.

203
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,708
I estimate over 20 lookouts onsite.

204
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,417
We believe the target will make the deal
at the third-floor skating rink.

205
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,375
Attention, all units.

206
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,083
The target is at the skating rink.

207
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,208
A-Team, surround the skating rink.

208
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,750
Back Stop, guard all entrances and exits.

209
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,083
Got it! Seaview Plaza, Tsuen Wan.

210
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,208
Officer Yiu, the Vietnamese Gang is here.

211
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:28,292
Take action?

212
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,708
Calm down. Wait until the goods
and money change hands.

213
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,333
All units, in position.

214
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,958
When the Vietnamese Gang arrives,
we will get them all at once.

215
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,958
What's wrong?
The monitors have gone blank!

216
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,958
Officer Yiu?

217
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,833
- Sir, we have interference.
- We're on it.

218
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,792
Hello, Vietnamese boys.

219
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,542
Are those party masks?

220
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,000
What the fuck?

221
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,375
That's some awesome shit, man!

222
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,875
Okay, straight to business.

223
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:03,708
Transfer the funds.

224
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,083
Fuck!

225
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,458
Are there cops outside?

226
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,875
Boss, there really are cops here.

227
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,667
Bastard, you dare mess with me?

228
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,333
Open fire at the scene!
Requesting urgent backup!

229
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:46,083
Officer Yiu, please respond! Officer Yiu!

230
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,875
All units, can you hear me?

231
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,333
Can you hear me?

232
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,958
What the fuck?

233
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,833
Yes!

234
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,958
Hang in there!

235
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,792
You bastards.

236
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,375
Hello, sir.

237
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,333
You bastards.

238
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,292
You look ridiculous.

239
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,708
Who are you?

240
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,000
Show your faces.

241
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,750
Let me see.

242
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,667
I dare you.

243
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,208
Go one-on-one with me.

244
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:06,792
Mano a mano!

245
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,667
It has been a long time.

246
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,333
Over there!

247
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,333
We're at Seaview Plaza.

248
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,458
Over 20 injured. Get ambulances here.

249
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:12,208
What's wrong with you?

250
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:15,000
I said rob, not kill.

251
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,958
You killed so many cops.

252
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,875
Relax, anger is bad for you.

253
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,292
Here. Where's our pay?

254
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,833
The cops are too close.

255
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,542
Take your time selling the goods.

256
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,625
You're teaching me?

257
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,375
Ngo.

258
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,833
What's with you?

259
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,333
We suffered all those years in jail.

260
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:45,083
Make all the money you can.

261
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:47,542
But don't go too far.

262
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,500
Too late. Don't ask.

263
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,125
Hey!

264
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,875
Chu, burn that car.

265
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,042
Wah, listen for any news.

266
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,125
- Keep us far from the cops.
- Got it.

267
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,458
Chuen.

268
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,917
Keep the guns, ammo, and vests.

269
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,000
No one here should know
where you store them.

270
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,542
Chiu.

271
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:23,750
The walkie-talkies.

272
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,708
None worked! What's wrong with you?

273
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:30,333
Sorry, Ngo.

274
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,750
After this is over,
I will divide the money that is left.

275
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,625
Meanwhile, stay under the radar.

276
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,500
Take care of your daughter.
Go to work as usual.

277
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,292
Don't go out unless you must.

278
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,083
- Let's drink to Bill.
- To Bill.

279
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,125
License check! Lights on, music off!

280
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,333
ID cards.

281
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,833
- I don't have it.
- Do you not have an ID card?

282
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,667
Quit bullying me, damned woman!

283
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,917
Damn you!

284
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:13,375
- Come here!
- Sit down!

285
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,000
What are you doing?

286
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,292
Where is Wong Kwun's stuff?

287
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,583
- No idea!
- Bong, something has happened.

288
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,417
- You really don't know?
- No!

289
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,458
I will pretend you really don't know

290
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:25,750
and give you another chance.

291
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,625
Close this joint or be my informant.

292
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,500
Wrap it up.

293
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:49,208
- What are you doing?
- Out of the way!

294
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,000
What are you doing?

295
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:57,542
Attack!

296
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:00,708
Attack!

297
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:05,375
- Victory!
- Flip the table over.

298
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,083
- Bad try!
- Want to play again?

299
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,917
- It's just luck.
- Lucky Bong.

300
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,625
Yes, sir?

301
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,958
Roger.

302
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,292
At 3:30 a.m. today,

303
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,917
business mogul S T Fok
was kidnapped at his home.

304
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,042
That is bad news.

305
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,625
What's worse is

306
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,708
he was with his female secretary.

307
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,792
The ransom is one billion dollars.

308
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,375
They warned Mrs. Fok
not to call the police.

309
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:38,042
So she called the Secretary of Security.

310
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:41,583
Could it be the mistress
who wants a billion dollars?

311
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,042
It's possible.

312
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,208
DCP has been cleared.

313
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:48,458
The operation is top-secret

314
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,167
for the safety
of the rescue mission and Mr. Fok himself.

315
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,958
These two thugs
have committed every crime.

316
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:56,167
One is called Coke,
the other is Wong Kwun.

317
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,583
These are their files.

318
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,417
Listen up.

319
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,583
The brass takes
Mr. Fok's kidnapping very seriously,

320
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,000
so we must rescue him
as quickly as possible.

321
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,625
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

322
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:12,125
Ngo and Bong.

323
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:18,958
Save Mr. Fok by any means necessary.

324
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,625
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,542
Goodbye, sir.

326
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:29,292
Shall we bet on his share price dropping?

327
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,750
INTERNATIONAL NIGHTCLUB
GOLDEN APPLE NIGHTCLUB

328
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,208
SHANGHAI HAIRSTYLE

329
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:45,458
- Congratulations.
- On what?

330
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,375
Another promotion next month.

331
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,958
You got your wish. Stay humble.

332
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,833
Envy me?

333
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:52,750
A little.

334
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,917
Congratulations, Star of Tomorrow.

335
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,750
- It's the same job.
- No, it's not.

336
00:28:57,833 --> 00:29:00,000
We might only catch ten thieves now.

337
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,208
When I get promoted,

338
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,750
we can catch hundreds and thousands.

339
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:03,875
Then there will be peace.

340
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,000
That would be good.

341
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,750
When you get married, there will be peace.

342
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,125
- Set more tables at your wedding banquet.
- Exactly.

343
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,667
- There are a lot of us.
- Of course.

344
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,708
- He won't lose money with so many of us.
- Count me out.

345
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,917
Sir, we have eyes
on Coke going to his car.

346
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:25,625
Will the groom take him on?

347
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,792
I will take him.

348
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,333
Wong Kwun is all yours, Bong.

349
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,792
Then there will be peace.

350
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:32,583
- Stay sharp.
- Roger.

351
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,875
We have eyes on Wong Kwun
about to leave in his van.

352
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,542
I wait for you every time.
Next time, it's your turn.

353
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,625
How much are we betting on?

354
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,917
A mahjong game?

355
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:19,917
Make our move anyway.

356
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:32,917
Where is S T Fok?

357
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:34,917
Speak!

358
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,417
Where is the hostage? Speak!

359
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,625
I don't know what you are talking about.

360
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,667
What hostage? What are you talking about?

361
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,167
Get up!

362
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,917
No one is beating you up.

363
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:55,833
Sir?

364
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:57,125
What is the situation?

365
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,458
He won't say anything. Give me more time.

366
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:00,792
Your time is up.

367
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,458
I don't care how you do it.

368
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:05,375
Mr. Fok must be safe
before the stock market opens tomorrow.

369
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:08,333
This is a private operation.

370
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:09,875
Everything is off the record.

371
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,958
The commissioner will not know about it.

372
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:15,708
If things go bad,
I will have your back, okay?

373
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,167
But if you mess up,

374
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,792
the brass will crush us both.

375
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:22,833
Got it?

376
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,625
Yes, sir.

377
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:40,125
What's going on? You're crazy!

378
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,208
Where is the hostage? Speak!

379
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:43,458
Speak!

380
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,458
Speak!

381
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:54,917
Bastard!

382
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,833
You will hear from my lawyer.

383
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,583
I don't know anything.

384
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,542
What are you doing?

385
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,333
- Come here!
- What are you doing?

386
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:19,917
I will count to three.

387
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,750
We'll see if you're really that tough.

388
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,917
I will make you swallow your own teeth!

389
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,708
One!

390
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:29,750
Two!

391
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,708
I will talk!

392
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:42,542
143 Wan Lee Street.

393
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:43,875
Bill, make the call.

394
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,167
143 Wan Lee Street, now!

395
00:32:58,917 --> 00:32:59,958
He's here.

396
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:03,042
Mr. Fok, don't worry. We are the police.

397
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:15,042
You could have saved yourself a beating.

398
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,792
Do you like being beaten?

399
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,417
Did your mom teach you that?

400
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,750
You asked for it.

401
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,917
The bastard is biting me!

402
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,042
Let go!

403
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:31,250
Let him go!

404
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,333
Let go!

405
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,375
Police! License check.

406
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,667
Take out your ID cards.

407
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,917
Stop playing now.

408
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,667
Stop. Show your ID card.

409
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,250
Behave.

410
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,250
Freeze!

411
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,875
- Out of the way!
- Freeze!

412
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,792
Open the door! Come out!

413
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,417
Stop fooling around! Do you hear me?

414
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,625
Come out!

415
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,583
Shall I blast the door open? Come out!

416
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,667
He's hiding something.

417
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,500
Come out!

418
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,417
Hi, Bong.

419
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Hi, Jaws.

420
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,042
Moe, what have you done?

421
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,375
How bold.

422
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,333
You dare to take Wong Kwun's stuff?

423
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:48,625
Where did you get it from?

424
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,042
I don't know.

425
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,833
I really don't know.

426
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:56,417
Guai!

427
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
It's from Guai.

428
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,833
CSU has determined that
the last lot of Wong Kwun's drugs

429
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:06,083
was the same as the stuff
from Au Man-guai,

430
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,792
also known as Guai.

431
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,708
A few years ago,
he was jailed for manslaughter.

432
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,958
He was released six months ago

433
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:14,542
and hid in Cha Kwo Ling

434
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,208
to recruit men.

435
00:35:16,292 --> 00:35:18,542
A lot of fake refugees joined him.

436
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,042
He also groomed many knife fighters.

437
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,042
In other words, he's a nutcase.

438
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,417
That's a dangerous area.

439
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,208
My friend in DATS told me

440
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:29,542
a cop went there and was chopped up.

441
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:32,583
They got a South Asian boy to cop to it.

442
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:33,917
There was nothing DATS could do.

443
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,708
No luck. Boss says we need a warrant.

444
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,375
We won't get it tonight.

445
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,583
So? Let's go anyway!

446
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:45,042
We have neither a permit nor backup.

447
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,625
It will be dangerous.

448
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:50,750
So? Let's just go home and sleep, then.

449
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,542
We are policemen!

450
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,625
There's a criminal,
but we don't catch him?

451
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:56,083
How is that right?

452
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,458
You're not afraid, are you?

453
00:35:57,542 --> 00:36:00,833
No, it's not that.
We must follow the rules.

454
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:02,708
You're telling me about rules?

455
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,417
If you're scared, just say so!

456
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:05,958
Hey.

457
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:07,375
You're funny.

458
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:09,417
Sometimes aggressive, sometimes sleepy.

459
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,375
Which side are you on?

460
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,583
I would like to sleep,
but we lost so many colleagues!

461
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,125
- I can't sleep!
- I can't sleep either!

462
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,542
- Stop it.
- Okay.

463
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,208
Okay.

464
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,042
Let's call it a day.

465
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:22,958
That's it, then.

466
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,292
We have been on duty
for over 20 hours straight.

467
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,417
Okay?

468
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,167
I know you're tired. Go home and rest.

469
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,167
Bong.

470
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,292
- We're just letting him go?
- Just go home.

471
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:39,208
- Listen to Bong. Call it a day.
- Bye!

472
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:53,625
ASIAN, YAU TSIM MONG DISTRICT,
PROCURING, GAMBLING, NARCOTICS

473
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:05,667
Gather around, everyone.

474
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,167
Things have changed.

475
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,792
Guai's goods are on the street.

476
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,167
Cheung Sung-bong found them.

477
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,167
Cops are everywhere. We could get caught.

478
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,167
So what should we do now?

479
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,042
You dare mess with me?

480
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,292
Do you have a death wish?

481
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:47,708
Damn you!

482
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:48,708
Stop it!

483
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,292
Bastard!

484
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,542
Stay out of trouble!

485
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:58,958
Stay out of trouble!

486
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:02,250
Don't call me unless it's urgent!

487
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,917
- What are you doing?
- What is he doing?

488
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,208
Who are you?

489
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:20,625
Who are you? Get down!

490
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,125
What? A cop is looking for me?

491
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,042
What the fuck?

492
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,833
What do you want? Who are you?

493
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:44,875
What do you want, sir?

494
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:52,625
There he is!

495
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,583
Let him go!

496
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,458
- Out of the way!
- There he is!

497
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,417
Go away!

498
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,917
- Sir, I'm not involved!
- Caught red-handed!

499
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:15,625
- Stop filming!
- This will get you 30 years.

500
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,125
Caught you!

501
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:19,542
Guai, congratulations!

502
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,000
You have been caught red-handed!

503
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:22,667
Hey!

504
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,042
- Guai.
- Sit down.

505
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:26,292
This damn cop insisted I bring him to you.

506
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,750
Sit down.

507
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,125
Shut up!

508
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,208
Well?

509
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,250
Quiet, downstairs.

510
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,750
It's just one handgun, not a machine gun.

511
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:49,667
Well, sir?

512
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,250
How can I help you?

513
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:55,542
Eight of my colleagues died
in last week's Tsuen Wan case.

514
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:59,083
A dozen are still in the ICU.

515
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,000
All for this stuff.

516
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:06,375
This is Wong Kwun's stuff,
and you have it now.

517
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:10,167
Explain yourself.

518
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:17,083
What if I said I found it?

519
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,292
Let's be frank, Au Man-guai.

520
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,167
You're in it for the money.

521
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,375
Tell me who did it,
and you will get a lighter sentence.

522
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,625
Here, take it.

523
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:43,917
You don't want it?

524
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:46,750
Give it to your men

525
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:48,667
to cover funeral expenses.

526
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:52,833
Being nice doesn't work with you.

527
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,250
You're coming to the station!

528
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:58,583
Don't you dare!

529
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,583
Calm down!

530
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,542
Don't try it.

531
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,333
What a mess. Let me clear this up first.

532
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,833
Boss, just tell him!

533
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:32,958
No way!

534
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,083
You bastard!

535
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:04,958
Freeze! All of you, drop your weapons!

536
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,375
- Come out!
- Come out!

537
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,375
- Come out!
- Come out if you dare!

538
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,083
I will kill you when you come out!

539
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:11,500
Stop!

540
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,000
Go back to the station with me.

541
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:51,250
Save it!

542
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,417
Let's go.

543
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,333
Back to the station.

544
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,250
Go to hell!

545
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,917
Tell me who did it!

546
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,167
No way in hell!

547
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,292
Tell me!

548
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:53,708
After long and detailed planning
by the police,

549
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,125
we successfully raided
a drug distribution facility

550
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,917
and found over 48 million dollars' worth

551
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,333
of pure crystal meth.

552
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:00,417
Our labs show

553
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,292
that it is from the same lot as
the drug-related robbery and murder

554
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,917
from last week.

555
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,708
The criminals involved in the case
were all shot dead by police

556
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:11,000
during our very successful operation.

557
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:13,375
The bastards love to brag.

558
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:17,417
They take all the credit
while we take all the risks.

559
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:22,125
That's life. What can we do?

560
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:25,042
Change careers.

561
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,333
What? I was joking.

562
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,417
I'm going home.

563
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,042
Are you really going home?

564
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,583
Yes.

565
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:54,500
We will get those bastards.

566
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,667
Damn, a whole tooth.

567
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,708
Let me clean you up.

568
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:28,083
You're all beat up.

569
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:29,875
This is the last time.

570
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:36,250
I'm sorry.

571
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:05,208
BILL CHEUNG

572
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:08,375
What did we do?
Please give us another chance.

573
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,792
We were loyal and dutiful.

574
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,875
We rescued people.

575
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Why won't anyone rescue us?

576
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:18,500
Why?

577
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:22,333
My wife and kids are waiting for me!

578
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:16,500
Leave.

579
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,958
I told you to leave! Understand?

580
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,333
Hey!

581
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,792
Enough! That's enough.

582
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,667
No offense.

583
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:49,417
None taken.

584
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,833
Don't you have bad guys to catch?

585
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:58,250
I come every year
to pay my respects to Bill.

586
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,167
Just to visit him.

587
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:03,167
I heard you will be a dad soon.

588
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,125
Congratulations.

589
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,083
Yes, soon.

590
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,500
I will be a dad soon.

591
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:13,625
And you? Are you still seeing Ching?

592
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:15,542
No.

593
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:19,375
Not since I got out.

594
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:22,625
I was jailed for years.
We canceled the wedding banquet.

595
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:25,208
I couldn't expect my fiancée to wait.

596
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:30,333
Over the years,

597
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,417
I often went to see you.

598
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,375
But you didn't want to see me. I get it.

599
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:38,417
I was in jail. What was there to see?

600
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:41,625
Now you're out.

601
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:44,083
What are your plans?

602
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:49,000
Do you know that Wong Kwun is dead?

603
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:53,333
So I heard.

604
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:56,292
We planned for years.

605
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:02,542
We were going to take them down
during a drug deal last week.

606
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,542
But out of nowhere,

607
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,958
a group who knew
the police's plans ambushed us,

608
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:11,417
took the goods, and killed many people,

609
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,667
including eight of our colleagues.

610
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,792
Yiu was one of them.

611
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:17,542
How reckless of him.

612
00:52:19,792 --> 00:52:21,500
Yiu was a cop for over 30 years.

613
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:26,167
He was a good cop and a good man.

614
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,583
You know he was my mentor.

615
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:32,667
Yes.

616
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:35,292
Without him, you wouldn't be a cop.

617
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,917
If not for you, I wouldn't have either.

618
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,375
But this society doesn't reward good men.

619
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,042
Bill was a good man. Now, he rests here.

620
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,333
I won't spare those bastards.

621
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,542
I will catch them all.

622
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:53,708
Good luck with that.

623
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:16,000
We got Wong Kwun.

624
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:17,833
He is lawyered up and not talking.

625
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:19,583
How are things on your end? Where are you?

626
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:21,000
Tsing Yi Dockyards.

627
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:29,792
Hey!

628
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:30,917
Stop!

629
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,792
Are you nuts? You guys are cops!

630
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,083
He's dead!

631
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,042
What now?

632
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:38,667
We were told to rescue Mr. Fok. We did.

633
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,042
Were we wrong?

634
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:41,792
Either the suspect dies

635
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,167
or Mr. Fok does.

636
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:45,125
Who would you choose?

637
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:52,333
I'm tired. I'm leaving.

638
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,375
Bong.

639
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:57,292
Bong!

640
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,458
Due to the sensitive nature of this case,

641
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:18,542
this trial will be conducted
behind closed doors.

642
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,958
Mr. S T Fok,

643
00:55:21,042 --> 00:55:24,083
from what you remember,
besides the late Ho Wai-lok,

644
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:27,167
was the other suspect,
Wong Kwun, involved in the kidnapping?

645
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,542
I really am not sure.

646
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,667
There was no need
to kill anyone, was there?

647
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,125
What? If not for us, you would be dead!

648
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,333
We saved your life
and you said there was no need?

649
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,167
Please calm down.

650
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,125
Defendants, control your emotions.

651
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,375
Mr. Seto Kit,

652
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,583
according to my clients' statements,

653
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:53,708
you instructed them to lynch the victim

654
00:55:53,792 --> 00:55:55,708
in order to solve the case.

655
00:55:55,792 --> 00:55:57,292
Do you admit to that?

656
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:03,625
Yes, I repeatedly requested

657
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,458
that they solve the case
as soon as possible,

658
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:07,958
but I didn't tell them to lynch

659
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,542
or kill anyone.

660
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,833
Superiors often ask their subordinates

661
00:56:12,917 --> 00:56:14,625
to complete their tasks quickly.

662
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:15,833
That is within reason.

663
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:19,083
But there are strict police guidelines

664
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,083
regarding force used in various operations

665
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:25,667
which officers must follow.

666
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,750
Thus, whether the six defendants
killed anyone

667
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:32,042
is unrelated to the fact that I asked them

668
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:33,917
to solve the case quickly.

669
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,917
What? You said you would have our backs!

670
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,417
Don't deny it now!

671
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,583
Please calm down.

672
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:42,792
Calm down.

673
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,667
I swear by Almighty God

674
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:56,042
to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

675
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,667
Senior Inspector Cheung Sung-bong,

676
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:11,208
according to the statements
of all six defendants,

677
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:13,542
you witnessed
the entire process on that day.

678
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:15,375
So I ask you.

679
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,875
Did you see the victim resist arrest

680
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,000
and fall to the ground to his death?

681
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,750
First, I must emphasize

682
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:30,000
that we received orders
from our superiors that night

683
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:33,208
to capture the two criminals,
Ho Wai-lok and Wong Kwun.

684
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:36,250
Your Honor, the witness
is avoiding the question.

685
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:39,667
I only asked
if he saw the victim resisting arrest.

686
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,542
Witness, please answer the question.

687
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:51,167
I had not yet arrived
at the scene when it happened.

688
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,500
So that is clearly a "no."

689
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:59,167
Did you see
the six defendants beating Ho Wai-lok?

690
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,375
Ho Wai-lok was

691
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,042
an extremely dangerous criminal.

692
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,625
I firmly believe that we as police

693
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:32,333
had to deal with him
with considerable force.

694
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:34,000
"Considerable force"?

695
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:36,125
What does that mean?

696
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:39,917
We cannot guess
how much force is "considerable."

697
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,042
Just answer me.

698
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:45,000
Did you see
the defendants beat Ho Wai-lok?

699
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:49,500
And, Inspector Cheung, let me remind you

700
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:52,875
that you are currently under oath.

701
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,500
Yes or no?

702
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,458
Yes or no?

703
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:09,083
Witness, please answer the question.

704
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:19,042
Yes.

705
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,167
Thank you.

706
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:01,083
Drink!

707
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:02,083
You're late! Drink!

708
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,917
Drink it all!

709
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:05,792
Joseph is at the other club.

710
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:07,292
- Let's join him.
- Yes!

711
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,042
Sure, I'll get the bill.

712
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,042
Check, please.

713
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:11,875
I got it.

714
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:12,958
How nice of you.

715
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,375
- Thank you. You're so generous.
- It's nothing.

716
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,000
Look at that! That looks fancy.

717
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,000
It's nothing special.

718
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,083
Nothing? It costs over a million dollars.

719
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:23,958
I guess so.

720
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:25,833
Keep the change. Thank you.

721
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,458
Thank my babe. He treated you tonight.

722
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,750
Thank you, babe!

723
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,875
- Thank you!
- "Babe!" Gross!

724
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,750
You're really giving it to me?

725
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:44,292
Yes, whatever makes you happy.

726
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,625
Thank you, you're so sweet.

727
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,167
Babe.

728
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:53,833
You're taking more?

729
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:59,167
It's fine, I don't mind.

730
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,125
Wait here. I'm going to take a shower.

731
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:24,208
Hey! Don't snoop on my phone!

732
01:01:25,917 --> 01:01:27,792
Who is this?

733
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:31,083
Just a friend.

734
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,750
Give me my phone back.

735
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,292
- No, you are mine!
- You're hurting me!

736
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:37,500
Bonnie, don't go.

737
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:41,542
Sorry, I--

738
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:42,875
Are you stupid?

739
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,417
Have you seen what you look like?

740
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:49,250
It's scary, dude.

741
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:53,250
And you're impotent, damned jailbird!

742
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,667
I hate being called "damned jailbird"!

743
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,708
If not for jail,
would my face look like this?

744
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,458
Bitch!

745
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:08,708
Bong, Marine Police
picked up a female corpse

746
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:09,917
at Chai Wan Pier an hour ago.

747
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,333
The victim's name is Kwan Mei-you.

748
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:13,042
This watch was found on her body.

749
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,917
CIB traced the serial number.

750
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,125
It was worn by Wong Kwun
on the day he was killed.

751
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,500
The victim was last seen in Wan Chai

752
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:23,667
renting a room with Chiu Chi-keung.

753
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,042
They were seen
on surveillance cameras entering a room.

754
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:29,125
But only Chiu came out,
dragging a suitcase.

755
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,625
What do you think?

756
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:43,333
Ngo did it.

757
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:46,792
He better not have.

758
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,292
Get to work.
Look into Chiu's phone records.

759
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:50,542
- Yes, sir.
- Roger.

760
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:25,125
Sit.

761
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:38,375
This is a huge job.

762
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,125
Do you have what it takes?

763
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:43,458
Don't mess with me.

764
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:45,917
It's a chance in a million.

765
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,875
Banks seldom switch security systems.

766
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:50,750
You're not the only interested party.

767
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,292
Don't waste our time.

768
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:56,250
Of course I'm interested.

769
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,500
Is your information correct?

770
01:03:58,583 --> 01:03:59,500
Of course.

771
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,792
If you're in, we will give it to you now.

772
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:08,958
Bong, the target stopped
at the Mei Fai Building ahead.

773
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:22,542
Keep moving, sir.

774
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,292
Go.

775
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,750
Target is moving to three o'clock.

776
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,250
Chow, your team will follow Chiu.

777
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,208
Roger.

778
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,250
Jaws, let me off at Mei Fai Building.

779
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:48,083
- Stay on them.
- Yes, sir.

780
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,583
Cops.

781
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,375
Ngo, we're being followed by cops.

782
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,708
Throw out all your SIM cards.

783
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:08,208
Your location?

784
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:09,750
We're heading to Chai Wan.

785
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:18,292
What is going on?

786
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,042
Why are cops following us?

787
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:24,417
What have you done this time?

788
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:29,375
Sorry.

789
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,125
Bastard! Stay alert!

790
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:36,458
I will follow Wah. You stay with Chiu.

791
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:37,667
Roger.

792
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,167
Freeze!

793
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,167
Freeze. Hands up.

794
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,125
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

795
01:06:20,792 --> 01:06:22,625
What? I can't go for a run?

796
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,083
You ran me down!

797
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,125
Cuff him.

798
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,417
- Into the car!
- Yes, sir.

799
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,458
Police. Do you have
comprehensive insurance?

800
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:07,125
All units,

801
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,500
don't let Chiu reach the highway.

802
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:09,917
Stop him at the next intersection.

803
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,833
Roger.

804
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,833
Police at work. Go back into your cars.

805
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:42,208
Close your doors.

806
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:50,167
- Do not come out. Hide.
- Stay in the car. Windows up.

807
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:52,583
Close the door.

808
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:01,292
Chiu is here.

809
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:03,125
Freeze! Hands up!

810
01:10:58,375 --> 01:10:59,250
Damn it!

811
01:11:59,542 --> 01:12:00,625
Went for a run?

812
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,583
You jumped out of a car!

813
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:05,042
So what?

814
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:06,958
There is no law that says I can't!

815
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:08,208
What's more,

816
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:12,208
you cops drove recklessly
and crashed into me.

817
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:14,708
- I will sue you.
- Don't mess with me!

818
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:18,000
Chiu is your buddy. You're part of this.

819
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,167
Admit it!

820
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:22,167
So much bullshit.

821
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,542
Don't you find it annoying?

822
01:12:24,292 --> 01:12:26,042
Is this how cops do things nowadays?

823
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:28,708
Arresting people on a whim?

824
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:31,542
You need evidence to charge me.

825
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:33,375
Where is it?

826
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:41,833
How are you, Wah?

827
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,542
How is your family, Wah?

828
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:59,042
Your daughter must be six years old now.

829
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,708
She must be in primary school.

830
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:04,250
Shouldn't you stay out of trouble

831
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:06,792
and spend more time with her?

832
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:09,042
You have been caught red-handed.

833
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:12,833
After a few more years in jail,
she won't even recognize you.

834
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:15,292
You must think of her.

835
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,417
Last chance.

836
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,667
Okay.

837
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,417
You know what to do.

838
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:38,708
Get up!

839
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,042
No more!

840
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:53,958
I'm sorry.

841
01:13:56,542 --> 01:13:57,542
I was greedy.

842
01:13:58,125 --> 01:13:59,833
I stole Wong Kwun's watch.

843
01:14:00,792 --> 01:14:02,917
There must be a way to rescue Wah.

844
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:05,750
He can keep secrets.

845
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:07,458
He won't rat us out.

846
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,042
We still have time.

847
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:14,333
Chiu has been caught.

848
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:16,583
But I know the police

849
01:14:16,667 --> 01:14:18,417
don't have enough evidence to charge us.

850
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,667
Stay cool.

851
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,625
There is nothing we can do.

852
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,625
We're on the same team.

853
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:25,083
When someone makes a mistake,

854
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,667
the others have to make up for it.

855
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:28,625
It's the same with anyone.

856
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,042
The question now is

857
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:34,625
how we can rescue Wah

858
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,250
from Cheung Sung-bong.

859
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,875
There is only one way.

860
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,542
How many times have I said it?

861
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:51,958
If anybody screws up,

862
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:53,750
they will have hell to pay.

863
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:23,792
These are former policemen.

864
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:26,375
Four years ago,
they were jailed for manslaughter.

865
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:27,875
They were released six months ago.

866
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:29,208
We have reason to believe

867
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:32,125
they were involved
in several armed robberies and murders.

868
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:34,750
We have checked all border records.

869
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:38,458
Last week, they sent
all their families out of Hong Kong.

870
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:42,292
It looks like
something major will happen soon.

871
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:45,375
We only have evidence to charge Chiu.

872
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,250
We must catch them all.

873
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,542
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

874
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,750
Okay, let's go.

875
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:51,833
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

876
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:52,917
Stop, all of you!

877
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:55,208
Who gave you permission to go?

878
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:57,292
I did.

879
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:59,208
Do you know
how many complaints we have had?

880
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:01,458
- Bong, we need to talk.
- Set out!

881
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:02,542
Bong!

882
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:08,125
Bong.

883
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:10,417
Please.

884
01:16:17,542 --> 01:16:19,833
I know how you feel.
I don't like it either.

885
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:21,333
But you must realize this.

886
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:23,917
So many colleagues died
last time at the mall.

887
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,625
We must not make any more mistakes.

888
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,042
Moreover,

889
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,667
I have handed this case
back to Officer Tai.

890
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:32,458
- We will let it go now, okay?
- Not okay.

891
01:16:32,542 --> 01:16:34,458
- It's not okay.
- This is an order.

892
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:35,958
- There's no way around it.
- Not okay.

893
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:37,458
You're a policeman!

894
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:38,667
So are you.

895
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:41,333
It's an order.

896
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:42,958
What can I do? Tell me.

897
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:46,167
Don't lord your title over me, okay?

898
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,625
- Beau.
- I can't--

899
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:48,958
Try to be human about this.

900
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:51,417
So many colleagues have died.
What else can I do?

901
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:55,958
You're putting me in a bad spot.

902
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:59,750
You can handle it, okay?

903
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:02,042
Okay. Let's go.

904
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,417
- Bong.
- Bong.

905
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,458
Ngo and his men are here.
They said they came to report a case.

906
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,125
What a big welcome!

907
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,958
We are just here to report a case.

908
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,292
Perfect.

909
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:38,083
You saved us a trip.

910
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,292
Make some coffee.

911
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:42,958
Yau Kong-ngo,
in these six months after your release,

912
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:45,125
there is no record
of your employment, residence,

913
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,250
travel, bank, or any other records.

914
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:48,625
You must have something planned.

915
01:17:50,042 --> 01:17:51,833
Wong Kwun was killed two weeks ago,

916
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,167
and his goods were taken.

917
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:56,542
We lost eight colleagues. Did you do it?

918
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,000
You had a conflict with Wong Kwun.

919
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:00,458
That is reason and motive.

920
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:01,708
Admit it.

921
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:04,083
Wah confessed

922
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:06,208
for the sake of his wife and daughter.

923
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:09,833
He said you were involved
as the mastermind.

924
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:11,708
I don't believe that.

925
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,375
You must have come prepared.

926
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:16,042
Please explain.

927
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:26,208
What are you laughing about?

928
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:31,875
I was in that seat for over a decade.

929
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,958
I have said the same things you have said.

930
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,042
Take a guess whether I believe you.

931
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:47,583
I came today to report a case.

932
01:18:48,125 --> 01:18:49,708
My friend is missing.

933
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:51,167
His name is Chiu Chi-keung.

934
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:53,292
You bastard cop-killer!

935
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:07,083
Fine.

936
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:09,667
Since you suspect us,

937
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,250
we're willing to cooperate.

938
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:14,250
We will stay here for 48 hours,

939
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,500
starting now.

940
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:19,042
Give me a coffee, please.

941
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:21,125
With milk, thank you.

942
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:23,417
Right away. Drink it if you dare.

943
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:35,708
He makes sense.

944
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:39,917
I will get you your coffee.

945
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,792
Less sugar and fresh milk.

946
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,458
Thank you.

947
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:00,708
Some things haven't changed.

948
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,500
I haven't smelled
the interrogation room in a long time.

949
01:20:11,042 --> 01:20:12,792
I remember
the first time I took a statement.

950
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:15,708
You were next to me, right over there.

951
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:20,500
I remember. It was Hoklo Mun.

952
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:23,750
I was the bad cop. You were the good cop.

953
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,250
You were so scared
that you got a stomachache.

954
01:20:28,542 --> 01:20:30,542
You love to remember my worst moments.

955
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:34,208
Well?

956
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:36,625
Chiu has vanished.

957
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,708
We are trying to find him.

958
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:40,958
I have told him many times

959
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:42,583
to stay away from shady guys

960
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:44,042
or he would get in trouble.

961
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:45,167
See?

962
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,875
Great, since you are here,

963
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:50,833
what can you tell us?

964
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:53,875
Bong, if not even you
can catch those bad guys

965
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:57,000
despite all the colleagues
who died along the way,

966
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:58,583
how can I hope to help you?

967
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:06,750
Of course you can. You're so clever.

968
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:08,500
I have a question for you.

969
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:11,000
Who is so bold,

970
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,042
has so little regard
for the law, so heartless,

971
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,875
and so cold-blooded?

972
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:18,125
Also, arresting them all
would bring peace.

973
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:20,042
What is your opinion on that?

974
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,708
I don't have an opinion.

975
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:26,458
Perhaps they have something against you.

976
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,417
In the end,
you need evidence to charge people.

977
01:21:30,292 --> 01:21:31,417
Without it,

978
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:33,875
you can't do anything.

979
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:36,208
We will get evidence sooner or later.

980
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:40,917
Being so high-profile,
they are bound to make a mistake.

981
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,833
Once they do, we will catch them.

982
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,125
You are so confident.

983
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:50,000
I worry that more colleagues
will die when the time comes.

984
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:52,542
This time, the bad guys will die first.

985
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:56,583
As policemen,
we can't worry about those things

986
01:21:56,667 --> 01:22:00,917
or we would have become postmen, right?

987
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:05,042
Postmen have it made,
just attending to mail all day.

988
01:22:05,917 --> 01:22:07,250
You seem to be

989
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,375
attending funerals all day.

990
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:20,792
Let's see who will attend whose.

991
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:38,917
You're different from them.

992
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:41,458
If you wish to become
the prosecution's witness,

993
01:22:41,542 --> 01:22:42,750
it is not too late.

994
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,875
I'm here to report a missing person.

995
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:48,583
Don't interrogate me like I'm a criminal.

996
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:51,125
I came to give you clues

997
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:53,625
to help you find Chiu faster.

998
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:56,708
The bad guys are all out there,
yet you're here talking to me.

999
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:58,167
Damn all this.

1000
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:08,625
More coffee!

1001
01:23:14,292 --> 01:23:18,500
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

1002
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:20,750
Okay, from the top.

1003
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:24,875
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

1004
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,083
Okay, stand still.

1005
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:29,667
Watch me. Good job.

1006
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:39,083
Chiu is dead. Police found his body.

1007
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:41,125
They found a letter at the scene.

1008
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:42,917
He took responsibility for everything.

1009
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,917
With him dead, all the leads are gone.

1010
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,625
It will be hard for us to charge them.

1011
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:00,500
Everybody, out.

1012
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:19,667
You need evidence to arrest people?

1013
01:24:29,417 --> 01:24:31,333
Evidence! Arrest!

1014
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:34,333
That's brave.

1015
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:36,042
What I am about to say

1016
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:38,000
will not be a legitimate testimony.

1017
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,375
You cannot use it in court.

1018
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,708
You're killing your own buddies now?

1019
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:45,750
You killed Chiu.

1020
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:48,458
It was you at the Wong Kwun incident.

1021
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:53,000
You also killed Yiu and all our men.

1022
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:57,500
Why did you kill all those innocent men?

1023
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:00,792
- Why?
- Innocent?

1024
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,833
Who can be more innocent than us?

1025
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,708
We gave our all to the police force.

1026
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,000
We solved the case.

1027
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:10,917
In court, you only needed to say one word,

1028
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,208
and the five of us
wouldn't have gone to jail.

1029
01:25:13,292 --> 01:25:16,792
But you gave up on us and put us in jail!

1030
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:18,292
Every night in jail,

1031
01:25:18,375 --> 01:25:20,917
the people we had arrested
would seek revenge on us.

1032
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,333
Here. These.

1033
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,000
Is that innocence?

1034
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:25,958
You think you're so noble

1035
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:27,958
because you spoke one truth in court.

1036
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:30,292
You defended a crook
over your own brothers.

1037
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,000
Coke was a criminal!

1038
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,583
Don't confuse right and wrong.

1039
01:25:34,667 --> 01:25:36,917
You went too far and needed to pay for it.

1040
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,333
You committed murder.

1041
01:25:38,417 --> 01:25:40,417
You had to go to jail.

1042
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:42,000
Is that innocence?

1043
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:43,042
What did you do?

1044
01:25:43,125 --> 01:25:44,958
You killed your colleagues and buddies.

1045
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:48,000
And you killed Yiu!

1046
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:50,625
You call that righteousness?

1047
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:53,250
You were settling a private grudge.

1048
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,542
If you wanted revenge,

1049
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:58,375
why didn't you just come to me?

1050
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:04,125
That was the original plan,

1051
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:06,667
but you weren't at the mall that day.

1052
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,542
Forty-eight hours have gone by so fast.

1053
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,375
You have to let me go.

1054
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:23,458
Bong!

1055
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:28,000
Your wife is being
held hostage at the dance hall.

1056
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:29,292
There's a bomb.

1057
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,417
You bastard!

1058
01:27:13,292 --> 01:27:15,500
Open fire at the scene.
PNC has been shot and injured.

1059
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:17,042
Bong, it's Seto Kit.

1060
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:18,708
He has your wife and demands to see you.

1061
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:19,917
He fired three shots.

1062
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:24,583
Bong, in addition to your wife,

1063
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:26,958
there are 10 children and 4 parents.

1064
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:28,292
It's a very dangerous situation.

1065
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:31,125
Also, Seto Kit has a bomb around his neck.

1066
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:32,750
EOD checked and said that

1067
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:34,458
there is a detector linked to his pulse.

1068
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:36,333
The design is very complex.

1069
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:39,500
The bomb squad has
no idea how to defuse it yet.

1070
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:40,625
What can we do?

1071
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:44,125
If we don't want the bomb to explode,

1072
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:46,375
all we can do is
stop his pulse by shooting him dead.

1073
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,125
One more problem.

1074
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:53,333
Seto cuffed himself to your wife.

1075
01:27:57,167 --> 01:27:58,417
Stop!

1076
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,542
Do you want more people to die?

1077
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:02,125
Where is Cheung Sung-bong?

1078
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:05,250
I'm here. Sir, let's talk it out.

1079
01:28:05,792 --> 01:28:08,000
Release my wife and the other hostages.

1080
01:28:09,542 --> 01:28:11,000
Come out. We will talk all you want.

1081
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:14,042
Shut up!

1082
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,292
Are you finally here?

1083
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:19,958
I'm here.

1084
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,042
What do you want me to do?

1085
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,458
The men back there, get out.

1086
01:28:24,542 --> 01:28:25,833
I only want to see him.

1087
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:28,375
Get out! Back out!

1088
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:30,208
Okay.

1089
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,417
Calm down.

1090
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:35,167
Let the EOD

1091
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,417
help you take off the bomb, okay?

1092
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:41,000
If you want to help me, listen up

1093
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:44,708
or my wife and daughter will die.

1094
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:47,542
Calm down.

1095
01:28:48,167 --> 01:28:50,333
Let me finish first!

1096
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,750
Four years ago,

1097
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:55,833
my behavior was inexcusable.

1098
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:58,875
I said you had to rescue him.

1099
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:01,500
I forced Ngo to be more aggressive.

1100
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:02,917
I also said

1101
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,583
that if you fail to rescue Mr. Fok,

1102
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:06,792
the whole team will be fired.

1103
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,875
I forced them onto this path.

1104
01:29:11,542 --> 01:29:13,125
I was greedy for the credit.

1105
01:29:14,167 --> 01:29:16,917
I wanted to be on S T Fok's good side.

1106
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:20,708
I should have taken responsibility,

1107
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:22,500
but I didn't.

1108
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:25,667
They were innocent.

1109
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:29,125
I am the shame of the police force.

1110
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:31,792
- I am the shame of the police force!
- I hear you, okay?

1111
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:33,708
Bong.

1112
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:36,042
You love to hear the truth, don't you?

1113
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,417
That was the truth.

1114
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,583
But we don't think he was sincere enough.

1115
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:43,167
Let's give him 30 more seconds

1116
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:46,500
and hope he can be more sincere.

1117
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:54,750
Why did this happen?

1118
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:57,167
EOD, withdraw.
Everyone has to leave immediately.

1119
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,083
Bong!

1120
01:29:58,167 --> 01:29:59,208
Retreat now!

1121
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:00,833
Stay away!

1122
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,167
Stay away!

1123
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:08,333
Give me wire cutters. Hurry!

1124
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:10,667
Wire cutters, now!

1125
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:13,083
I have already confessed.

1126
01:30:13,167 --> 01:30:14,958
Take the children and go! Quickly!

1127
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:16,417
- Go!
- Run!

1128
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,875
Help them, quickly! Go, evacuate!

1129
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:20,167
Get the children out of here.

1130
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:22,083
Everybody, out! It's going to blow! Run!

1131
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,792
Bong, get out now!

1132
01:30:24,417 --> 01:30:26,417
Go. Leave me.

1133
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:28,250
We will be fine.

1134
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:30,708
The timer is connected to his pulse.

1135
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:32,458
If his heart stops,

1136
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:33,625
so will the timer.

1137
01:30:33,708 --> 01:30:36,417
Shoot him dead
if you want to save your wife.

1138
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:39,208
Sir, there is no more time.

1139
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:41,917
You can do this.

1140
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,083
Okay.

1141
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:45,500
Fire!

1142
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:58,792
It's over.

1143
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:00,500
You're okay.

1144
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:02,875
I hope you understand
how little control we had back then.

1145
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:06,708
Good luck.

1146
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:15,417
Get everyone out, now!

1147
01:31:42,083 --> 01:31:45,250
Officer Cheung, we are
from Internal Investigations.

1148
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:49,417
You are suspected of
intentionally shooting at the SDU,

1149
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:53,542
disobeying multiple orders,
and violating police policies.

1150
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:55,250
This is the warrant for your arrest.

1151
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:57,917
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

1152
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,583
Please cooperate with our investigation--

1153
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:03,250
Doctor, how are my wife and baby?

1154
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:07,000
Mrs. Cheung's blood pressure
and heart rate are high

1155
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:09,708
due to the trauma.

1156
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:12,333
Please don't worry. She is stabilized.

1157
01:32:12,417 --> 01:32:14,083
- Thank you.
- Please don't worry.

1158
01:32:16,542 --> 01:32:17,625
Officer Cheung,

1159
01:32:17,708 --> 01:32:20,500
as a fellow officer, don't make this hard.

1160
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:22,792
Are you serious? His wife is unconscious.

1161
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:25,083
Fine, I will go with you.

1162
01:32:41,792 --> 01:32:42,917
Wing.

1163
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:45,625
Well?

1164
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:47,167
Has everything been arranged?

1165
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,667
Yes, long ago.

1166
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:53,208
I have the most powerful guns
and bombs ready for you.

1167
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:57,458
The bank vault
and security details are all here.

1168
01:32:59,167 --> 01:33:00,250
But...

1169
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:04,750
You are not part of this.

1170
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:06,083
What do you mean?

1171
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:08,833
You dare ask me?

1172
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,792
You have been exposed.

1173
01:33:11,292 --> 01:33:13,042
You are now fugitives.

1174
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:14,958
I don't want to go to jail yet.

1175
01:33:15,042 --> 01:33:16,167
Don't give me that.

1176
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,375
You would give up on

1177
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:19,042
100 million USD?

1178
01:33:20,292 --> 01:33:22,250
I said you have no part in this,

1179
01:33:22,333 --> 01:33:24,083
but I never said I wouldn't do it.

1180
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:28,875
To tell you the truth,
I have found another partner.

1181
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:31,250
You may go.

1182
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,292
What?

1183
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:41,458
Why are you still here?

1184
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,583
Get out!

1185
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,542
You have no part

1186
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:40,167
in this job either.

1187
01:34:57,542 --> 01:34:58,583
Officer Cheung.

1188
01:34:59,458 --> 01:35:02,750
That's it then. Wednesday night, 8 p.m.

1189
01:35:05,042 --> 01:35:06,583
What are you waiting for? Let's begin.

1190
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:08,458
I have a meeting to get to.

1191
01:35:08,542 --> 01:35:09,500
Turn it off.

1192
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,417
Senior Inspector Cheung Sung-bong,

1193
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,583
this is an internal investigation hearing

1194
01:35:18,667 --> 01:35:21,583
presided over by SACP Lok Chi-fai.

1195
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:24,333
The results will be submitted
to the Secretary of Justice.

1196
01:35:24,417 --> 01:35:26,792
You may be convicted. Do you understand?

1197
01:35:30,083 --> 01:35:33,375
You shot at the SDU team. Am I correct?

1198
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:36,625
You are correct.

1199
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:39,458
If you do not have
a reasonable explanation,

1200
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:41,750
the Department of Justice will charge you.

1201
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:43,292
You may be jailed.

1202
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:44,792
Do you understand?

1203
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:48,042
Yes.

1204
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:56,167
- Excuse us, sirs.
- What are you doing here?

1205
01:35:58,917 --> 01:36:00,833
No auditors are allowed
at the hearing. Get out.

1206
01:36:00,917 --> 01:36:04,500
I know it is wrong of us to barge in.

1207
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:06,167
But we hope

1208
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:09,333
you will be merciful and not fire him.

1209
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:11,208
Regardless of your relationship with him,

1210
01:36:11,292 --> 01:36:13,208
per regulations, you must leave now.

1211
01:36:13,292 --> 01:36:15,583
Sir, we are a team.

1212
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:17,708
If he did anything wrong, so did we.

1213
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:20,125
We must all bear the responsibility, sir!

1214
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,208
The police force is
about responsibility and discipline,

1215
01:36:33,292 --> 01:36:34,292
not emotions.

1216
01:36:35,417 --> 01:36:36,833
If you don't leave now,

1217
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:38,417
you will be disciplined.

1218
01:37:06,417 --> 01:37:07,708
Sirs,

1219
01:37:11,667 --> 01:37:13,917
the world really is

1220
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:16,542
not just black and white.

1221
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:20,417
There are a lot of grey areas.

1222
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:25,667
In this incident, I really had no choice.

1223
01:37:26,917 --> 01:37:28,000
True,

1224
01:37:28,083 --> 01:37:30,667
I was wrong to shoot at policemen.

1225
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:33,250
But I believe

1226
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:35,208
that anyone else in my position

1227
01:37:35,792 --> 01:37:37,500
would not have made another choice

1228
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:38,583
because...

1229
01:37:39,958 --> 01:37:41,375
I was saving my wife.

1230
01:37:44,208 --> 01:37:46,042
I think you
would have done the same thing.

1231
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:52,292
I entered the Academy when I was 19.

1232
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:55,833
I understand how to play this game.

1233
01:37:55,917 --> 01:37:59,417
Today, many people
who join the police force

1234
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,042
think about making connections
rather than catching bad guys.

1235
01:38:03,667 --> 01:38:05,458
True, we learned a lot,

1236
01:38:05,542 --> 01:38:07,333
but all we do

1237
01:38:07,417 --> 01:38:09,833
is cover our asses and wait.

1238
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:11,583
I get why I'm here.

1239
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:14,333
Sir, it's just a job.

1240
01:38:14,417 --> 01:38:15,958
Must we risk our lives?

1241
01:38:18,542 --> 01:38:20,042
But at the right time,

1242
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:26,292
we can be very persistent for one cause.

1243
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:28,958
We can even sacrifice ourselves,

1244
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:30,542
ignoring our own safety.

1245
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:33,375
What are we thinking?

1246
01:38:33,458 --> 01:38:36,542
Not how to do less work,

1247
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:39,500
but how to do better work.

1248
01:38:46,292 --> 01:38:47,583
Anything else?

1249
01:38:49,083 --> 01:38:50,083
Yes.

1250
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:56,167
Regretfully, these criminals will escape.

1251
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:58,375
I couldn't catch them.

1252
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:11,833
It's decided.

1253
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,042
Today's hearing

1254
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:23,208
is adjourned

1255
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:25,792
because I'm not feeling well.

1256
01:39:26,292 --> 01:39:29,042
We shall continue tomorrow
at the same time.

1257
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:31,917
I cannot control
whether the DOJ will charge you.

1258
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:35,000
But you are still a policeman

1259
01:39:35,667 --> 01:39:37,042
for the next 24 hours.

1260
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:40,750
Don't disappoint me.

1261
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,375
Hurry and catch those bastards.

1262
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:49,042
Thank you, sir.

1263
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:52,792
Thank you, sir.

1264
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:55,625
Thank you, sir.

1265
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:10,917
Bong, Central Crime Unit
has taken over the case.

1266
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
They found a USB drive on Ma Gau-wing

1267
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:15,167
containing all
the security data of BPA Bank.

1268
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:17,667
They suspect a bank truck robbery.

1269
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,333
All manpower is stationed there.

1270
01:40:34,917 --> 01:40:36,375
Got it. Thank you.

1271
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:40,125
Bong, we just learned
that someone named David Wong

1272
01:40:40,208 --> 01:40:41,375
is among the dead.

1273
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:44,417
He was the head of security
for Fok's HK Fortune Banking.

1274
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:47,000
There is a shareholders meeting
at HK Fortune Banking today.

1275
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,042
That means S T Fok
has returned from the US.

1276
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:54,958
It is said that all merchants are evil.

1277
01:40:55,042 --> 01:40:58,000
Doing business is like warfare.

1278
01:40:58,083 --> 01:41:00,083
You can't win
without a bright and clear mind.

1279
01:41:00,167 --> 01:41:02,208
Who would want to be cannon fodder?

1280
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:03,458
It's simple.

1281
01:41:03,542 --> 01:41:05,583
The lower class earns money with labor.

1282
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:08,000
The middle class
earns money with knowledge.

1283
01:41:09,167 --> 01:41:11,083
Officer Hsia, the target isn't here.

1284
01:41:11,167 --> 01:41:13,333
- They already let you out?
- The target is not here.

1285
01:41:13,417 --> 01:41:15,250
The USB drive found on Ma Gau-wing

1286
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:17,917
was planted to misdirect the police.

1287
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:21,292
Look at me! The target is at Fok's bank.

1288
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:23,292
HK Fortune Banking!

1289
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:24,625
Prove it.

1290
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:29,375
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1291
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,167
The evidence in this USB drive

1292
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,042
is the bank truck routes

1293
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:40,250
and security guard shift changes.

1294
01:41:40,333 --> 01:41:42,917
Everything points to the target being

1295
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
this bank's cash-in-transit truck.

1296
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:47,208
There is no harm
in sending some men there.

1297
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:07,542
What do you think you're doing?

1298
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:09,500
Don't try anything! What are you doing?

1299
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:13,708
Don't mess with us.

1300
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:16,542
Look, I won't transfer any manpower.

1301
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:17,958
Why don't you go there yourselve

1302
01:42:18,042 --> 01:42:21,042
since you are used to breaking the rules?

1303
01:42:21,125 --> 01:42:22,667
Just stay out of my way.

1304
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:23,833
Understand?

1305
01:42:24,708 --> 01:42:26,875
We are here
to give you leads, not get in your way.

1306
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:28,500
What you are doing here is useless!

1307
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:30,417
- Understand?
- You are in no position to speak!

1308
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,583
Do you know you have
violated your superior's orders?

1309
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:33,875
I have the right to report you!

1310
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:38,458
Control Room, done.

1311
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:43,958
Mr. Fok, we are ready.

1312
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:45,708
Don't try anything stupid!

1313
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:54,500
It's useless for me to come in here.

1314
01:42:54,583 --> 01:42:57,208
- This door is controlled by security--
- Come here.

1315
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:08,000
Open it!

1316
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:11,417
Don't shoot!

1317
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:19,583
I beg you. I was wrong.

1318
01:43:19,667 --> 01:43:21,000
I did you wrong.

1319
01:43:21,667 --> 01:43:23,292
I am grateful you rescued me.

1320
01:43:23,917 --> 01:43:26,583
My statement in court wasn't aimed at you.

1321
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:28,250
That's not what I meant.

1322
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:30,417
But you did kill someone!

1323
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,958
Please take all this money.

1324
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,375
I can arrange your escape
anywhere you choose.

1325
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:09,458
Call for backup!

1326
01:44:09,542 --> 01:44:10,417
Calling Control.

1327
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,292
Suspects discovered
leaving HK Fortune Banking

1328
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:13,750
and heading towards Tsim Sha Tsui.

1329
01:44:13,833 --> 01:44:15,333
They are believed to be heavily armed.

1330
01:44:15,417 --> 01:44:16,625
Requesting backup.

1331
01:44:23,292 --> 01:44:24,417
Bong, we have news.

1332
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,167
S T Fok's body has been found
in HK Fortune Banking's vault.

1333
01:44:38,875 --> 01:44:39,708
Sit tight!

1334
01:45:09,917 --> 01:45:11,000
Get out of here!

1335
01:45:11,083 --> 01:45:12,333
It's dangerous!

1336
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:33,958
Move! Out of the way!

1337
01:45:37,917 --> 01:45:38,958
Out of the way!

1338
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:40,542
Out of the way!

1339
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:02,083
Get out of the way! It's dangerous!

1340
01:46:02,167 --> 01:46:03,542
Move!

1341
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:08,167
Out of the way!

1342
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:23,583
Ngo, drop your weapons!

1343
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:25,667
You won't get away with this!

1344
01:46:30,792 --> 01:46:32,167
Fuck you!

1345
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,333
Jaws, cover fire!

1346
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:01,333
Forward!

1347
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
Bong, they are crazy!

1348
01:48:46,042 --> 01:48:47,500
Can everyone get away?

1349
01:48:47,583 --> 01:48:48,833
Easy as pie!

1350
01:48:48,917 --> 01:48:50,208
Let's eat hot pot tonight!

1351
01:48:50,292 --> 01:48:51,625
Roger!

1352
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:06,792
Mom!

1353
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:10,083
Surrender.

1354
01:50:10,167 --> 01:50:11,958
- What do you mean?
- Listen to me, Wah.

1355
01:50:12,042 --> 01:50:13,125
Do you want everyone to die?

1356
01:50:13,208 --> 01:50:15,208
Drop your gun! I said, drop it!

1357
01:50:15,292 --> 01:50:17,042
It's not too late to surrender.

1358
01:50:17,833 --> 01:50:19,625
- Put down your gun!
- Okay!

1359
01:50:19,708 --> 01:50:21,750
I will. Please calm down.

1360
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:24,083
You used to be a cop too.

1361
01:50:24,167 --> 01:50:25,833
Why are you taking a little girl hostage?

1362
01:50:25,917 --> 01:50:27,375
You have a daughter too!

1363
01:50:30,583 --> 01:50:31,625
Come here!

1364
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:21,500
Ngo.

1365
01:51:25,083 --> 01:51:26,500
I can't go on.

1366
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:37,667
Hang in there.

1367
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:49,583
I need to rest.

1368
01:51:54,417 --> 01:51:56,042
Let's be buddies again in our next lives.

1369
01:52:03,542 --> 01:52:04,625
Run!

1370
01:52:57,833 --> 01:52:59,167
You have nowhere to run.

1371
01:53:00,833 --> 01:53:02,083
Surrender.

1372
01:53:03,833 --> 01:53:05,167
And go back to jail?

1373
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:09,875
You say one thing and do something else.

1374
01:53:09,958 --> 01:53:11,417
Ching was that way too.

1375
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:13,917
So as soon as I got out, I killed her.

1376
01:56:34,167 --> 01:56:35,292
Get up!

1377
01:59:40,292 --> 01:59:41,542
I have lost.

1378
01:59:42,083 --> 01:59:44,042
But I won't bow to my fate!

1379
01:59:45,083 --> 01:59:48,750
I had one thought when I was in jail.

1380
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:02,500
If it had been you

1381
02:00:02,583 --> 02:00:04,208
who chased Coke that day,

1382
02:00:05,333 --> 02:00:06,917
would our destinies

1383
02:00:07,958 --> 02:00:09,625
have been reversed?
